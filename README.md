# SS-Hugo

Our starting point for Hugo themes.

## Usage

1. `hugo new site-name-here .` Note: the `.` creates the site in the current directory. It's also possible to specify a path.
2. `cd site-name/themes`
1. `git clone https://github.com/Pixel-and-Kraft/ss-hugo.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp watch`
4. open `http://localhost:3000`
5. have at it. enjoy. even have fun :)

**For the Curious:**  
The repo's "ss" is short for "Solid Start."
